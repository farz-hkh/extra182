# How to Integrate your github pages with jekyll
----

# Step 1
Assuming you've already installed jekyll along with the ruby-devkit, you can step forward. If you haven't, go to [How to Install Jekyll with Rubydevkit](tutorials/Install-Jekyll.html)

# Step 2
So, what we need to do now is, go to the docs [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)

# Step 3
After that open your cmd, click Windows and then type cmd. And choose that

# Step 4
And then, type like in jekyll docs. We're gonna try to install bundler here.

# Step 5
Next, we're gonna test it out using name directory myblog

# Step 6
Go into that directory

```
  cd myblog
```

# Step 7
Now try it with this command

```
  bundle exec jekyll serve
```

# Step 8
Now what we actually need to do is to copy the content of myblog folder, and then paste it into your folder. But, if there's a question whether replace or not choose NOT, because we only need something in our folder that doesn't have but the myblog folder.

# Step 9
Now see it for yourselves
